# Docker_helloWorld
Docker_first_image
I have created my first image of docker "HelloWorld" which shows message Hello World with StopWatch.
Here is link of my image of Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mdfurquan313/helloworld/general
You can use this image, run a command as "docker pull mdfurquan313/helloworld". To run the image you need to run a command as "docker run -dp 3000:80 <image_id?"
